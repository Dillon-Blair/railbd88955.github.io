    <h3>By Dillon Blair</h3>

    <p> Please peruse this page for your amusement. It offers three links to sites that contain loads of humorous content.</p>
    
    <h2>Akinator</h2>
    <p>This website lets you play a video game where a character asks you a series of questions to determine what fictional or non fictional character you're thinking of.</p>

    <h2>Liver King's Instagram</h2>
    <p>This guy is very amusing and entertaining to me. His message is greatly flawed and his character is not good. But, he is hilarious in a certain sense. </p>
